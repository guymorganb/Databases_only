# Database & Backend API Collection

This repository is a compilation of backend implementations featuring both SQL and NoSQL databases, complete with RESTful routing. It serves as a resource for exploring different database schemas and the corresponding API routes that interact with them.

## About the Repository

The backends provided here are designed with REST API principles and can be interfaced with through API clients like Postman and Insomnia. These backends demonstrate CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and showcase how to structure API endpoints to interact with database entities.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL Databases**: Examples using MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Examples using MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.
- **Node.js/Express**: For setting up the server and routing (if applicable).
- **ORM/ODM Tools**: Such as Sequelize for SQL and Mongoose for MongoDB.
- **Authentication**: Implementations for secure routes (if applicable).

## Getting Started

To get started with these backend projects, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/database-backend-routing.git
cd database-backend-routing
```


## Using the APIs

Each backend project is contained within its own directory and includes individual README.md files with specific setup instructions.
Once you have a project running locally, you can test the API endpoints using:

- Postman
- Insomnia

To test an endpoint, set up a new request in your API client with the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the URL corresponding to the route you wish to test. Don't forget to include any required headers or body data for POST/PUT requests.

## Project Structure

- Project-Name-SQL: A SQL database example with fully implemented CRUD API routes.
- Project-Name-NoSQL: A NoSQL database example with fully implemented CRUD API routes.
- ...additional projects

Each project directory has its own detailed README.md for guidance on installation, dependencies, and running the server.
